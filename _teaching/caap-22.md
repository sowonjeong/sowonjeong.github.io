I was an instructor for 6-weeks Summer session covering statistics as a preparation for College Core Curriculum. Course materials are largely from [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). [Here](https://caap-stats-22.github.io/) is the course webpage I maintained for the course.

The Chicago Academic Achievement Program ([CAAP](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-services/chicago-academic-achievement-program)) is a year-long program that provides early exposure to scholarly and social life at the University of Chicago to a group of academically talented incoming first-year students, many of whom are the first in their family to go to college or from lower-income backgrounds.
