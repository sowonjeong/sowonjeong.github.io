Welcome! I am Sowon, a 2nd year Master's student at the University of Chicago, Department of Statistics. During my master's, I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/), and have worked with Professor [Lek-heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before coming to UChicago, I received my B.A in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University, Korea.
