Welcome! I am Sowon, an incoming Statistics PhD Student at the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. 

I completed my master's at the University of Chicago, Department of Statistics. During my master's, I am lucky to be advised by Professor [Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/), and have worked with Professor [Lek-heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). Before coming to UChicago, I received my B.A in Applied Statistics from Yonsei University, Korea.

My research interest broadly lies in machine learning, high-dimensional statistics and optimization.
